# Interactive Notifications for iOS and Apple Watch
Supporting Apple Watch without the Kit.

## Notes :)
* authenticationRequired:false + FOREGROUND is useless? Will still show and ask to unlock.
* When the app is in foreground it will not display a notification
* When to reset the badge? When the app opens/resumes? Take chat app as example where you would update the badge when a thread was read.
* alertAction will show instead of open in alert and lockscreen
* alterLaunchImage
* Still need to fix the LiveView bug
